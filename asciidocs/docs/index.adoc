== Summary

=== Centralized Logging

Logs from various sources are collected in one location, offering unified search and analysis.

Examples:

* ELK Stack
* Splunk
* Graylog

Pros:

* Easier management
* Real-time analytics
* Powerful monitoring

Cons:

* Costly
* Relies on robust network infrastructure

Best For:

* Security monitoring
* Compliance and auditing
* Root cause analysis in large, complex systems

=== Decentralized Logging

Logs are stored locally where events occur, functioning independently of the network.

Examples:

* rsyslog
* Windows Event Log
* Local file storage

Pros:

* Simple setup
* Reliable
* Network-independent

Cons:

* Harder to analyze
* Time-consuming for large systems

Best For:

* Local troubleshooting
* Low-latency or bandwidth-sensitive environments

== Key Considerations

* Scale & Complexity: Centralized logging is better for large-scale systems.
* Network Reliability: Decentralized logging is more resilient to network issues.
